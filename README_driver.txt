Hi!

To run driver.py on cmd

locate your python.exe 

on Windows command prompt: python search_alg.py <algorithm> <list of values>

Example: python "./driver.py" dfs 8,6,4,2,1,3,5,7,0

In there do:

"dfs" "8,6,4,2,1,3,5,7,0" in parameters field

and -s in interpreter options field

Progress: dfs and bfs is functional

ast is more or less correct, but the nodes expanded value is off by a margin of 10%.
